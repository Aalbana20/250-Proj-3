# Binary Search Tree (BST)

This program implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++. The BST is a binary tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, the left child and the right child. The key property of a BST is that the value in each node must be greater than all values stored in the left sub-tree, and less than all values stored in the right sub-tree.

## Files

- BSTree.h: Header file containing the class definition for the Binary Search Tree.
- BSTree.cpp: Source file containing the implementation of the Binary Search Tree methods.
- main.cpp: Source file containing the main function.

## How to Use

- Follow the instructions in the program. It will generate 40 random numbers (less than 100), insert them into a BST, and perform operations such as traversal, search, deletion, and finding the minimum and maximum values.
